Macroeconomics</h4>\n                        <p>\n                          In developing the XBT protocol, we explored a wide range of questions around the open areas of\n                          research in money today, and found the concept of \"denationalized money” to be helpful for understanding\n                          how cryptocurrencies fit into a broader context.\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                          Drawing the connection between a technology innovation (cryptocurrencies) and an economic concept\n                          (denationalized money) allows us to benefit from the rich academic literature devoted to understanding\n                          where modern day monies face their greatest difficulties and where independent monies create value.\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                          The mandate of denationalized money is to check against inflation and boom-bust cycles. Both of these\n                          forces emerge from otherwise highly effective central banking systems, which is why economists have\n                          assigned the task of checking them to monetary-assets that operate independently of government. Today's\n                          decentralized cryptocurrencies are uniquely suited to this role, and in our opinion it will be their\n                          most important economic function.\n                        </p>\n                      </div>\n                    </c-generic-section>\n\n                    <c-generic-section top-divider>\n                      <div class=\"container-xs\">\n                        <h4>2.

Supply changes expand directly to wallets and contract directly\n                          from wallets, with no bank or marketplace in between.\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                          Later, we discovered the XBT solution has the tremendous additional benefit of creating a new asset\n                          movement pattern unlike any existing cryptocurrency or traditional asset.\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                          XBT's non-dilutive supply changes introduce a fundamentally different set of incentives for traders\n                          because changes in demand are expressed by the number of XBT held in addition to price. As a result,\n                          profit-maximizing actors are compelled to devise new trading strategies.

In this period of its lifecycle, XBT benefits from use as a diversifying asset to be\n                          held in investment portfolios, and from use as a decentralized collateral asset.\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                          Later on, as XBT's market cap grows, equilibrium periods will last for longer stretches of time.

Use in this\n                          regard would be major step forward for crytocurrencies, because it means the currency would have a\n                          real-exchange-rate (ie: 1 XBT for 1 can of soda) in addition to a nominal-exchange-rate (ie: 10000 XBT\n                          for 1 BTC).\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                          Because real-exchange-rates are much more resistant to change than nominal-exchange-rates, the use of a\n                          currency for denomination contributes to what Economists refer to as nominal rigidity (or price and wage\n                          stickiness).\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                          This stickiness further allows currencies like the USD to resist macroeconomic shocks, and has played a\n                          major role in the longevity of currencies throughout history.
